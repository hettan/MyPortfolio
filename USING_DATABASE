The databasefile is located in web/data.csv file.
In order to add/remove/edit you will have to know the basics behind this type of databasefile.

CSV files is using commas(,) as seperators.
The first enry defines the names of the fields.
Rest if the entries is values for that entry.

There's some rules on what values you can use for certain fields.
All fields should be as a string mening text within "" except:
project_id: Must be a project_id unique number
techniques_used: Should still use "" but if there's more then one technique you have to use comma as a seperator ex, "flask,python,jinja2".
group_size: Must be a number


If you don't understand the basics you can use this template and just replace the values with what you want it to be.

"Replace with the project name",replace with a unique id(number) for the project ex(4),"Replace with start date of the project","Replace with end date of the project","Replace with course code ex(TPD003)","Replace with course name","N/A","Replace with techniques used, use comma as seperator if more then 1. ex(python,flask,jinja2)","Replace with project description","replace with filename of project thumbnail file located in web/static/images folder","replace with file name of project picture located in web/static/images folder",replace group size for the project (must be a number),"replace with external link for the project","replace with lulz_had, choose one of these three options (few, medium, many)"

Here's an example of a finished entry:
"MyFlaskProject",4,"2011-09-01","2011-10-21","TDP003","Python project","N/A","python,flask,jinja2","A online web portfolio for listing all projects","A online web portfolio for listing all projects and this is the full description","x.png","xxx.jpg",1,"YY","medium"
